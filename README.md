```shell
git clone https://github.com/niamu01/ft_printf
cd ft_printf
make [all, re, clean, fclean] #(Did not undertake the bonus section)
```
- `make all`: Compiles mandatory files and creates the libftprintf.a file.
- `make re`: Performs an incremental build.
- `make clean`: Removes object files.
- `make fclean`: Removes object files and the library file.

This project compiles various functions into a single library file and prevent relinking.

## How To Use
You can use the libftprintf.a file generated by make in another project

### Example:
```shell
gcc -o my_program main.c -L/path/to/ft_printf -lftprintf
```
> 💡 Ensure the `/path/to/ft_printf` is replaced with the actual path to your `libftprintf.a` file.
